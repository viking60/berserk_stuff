.SH NAME
MultiCD \- Build a custom CD/DVD/USB image from multiple live CDs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B multicd
[OPTIONS]
.SH DESCRIPTION
MultiCD is a shell script that looks for bootable ISO9660 images (live CDs) that it can recognize in the current directory and builds a new, combination ISO image that can be burned to a CD or DVD (with 
.I wodim
or similar) or copied to a flash drive (with 
.I dd
- this will delete all data on the drive.) It also accepts any floppy disk image (.img extension).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fBclean\fR
Removes all symbolic links to files in the current directory, as well as all files ending in ".defaultname" or ".version". From version 6.7 on, this is also run after MultiCD has successfully made the ISO. You still might want to run it manually if a build fails, and you later change what ISOs you are using.
.TP
\fBgui\fR
Launches zenity to ask the user for a working directory, then launches an X terminal (using
.I x-terminal-emulator
on Debian/Ubuntu,
.I xterm
otherwise) to actually run MultiCD in. This is used by the .desktop launcher in the menu. If zenity is not installed, MultiCD will open a terminal window to give an error message.
.TP
\fB-c\fR
Creates an md5sum.txt on the root of the ISO with the checksums of all other files. Can be checked with the -c option of 
.I md5sum
.TP
\fB-d\fR
Enables debug mode - launches a bash shell before the ISO is built. This way, you can poke around in the ISO and change things (or figure out why things aren't working.)
.TP
\fB-i\fR
Enables interactive mode. Lets you configure some of the CD options, such as the menu title/color, volume label, boot language (only certain MultiCD plugins support this), and whether to leave out certain modules in Porteus.
.TP
\fB-m\fR
Do not include Memtest86+. Normally, it is downloaded from memtest.org (if not already present in the working directory).
.TP
\fB-o\fR <output-file>
Change the output file from multicd.iso to something else. The specified filename cannot have spaces.
.TP
\fB-t\fR
Launch
.I kvm
(preferred) or
.I qemu
after the ISO is built. kvm/qemu is launched in the background before MultiCD exits.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Verbose mode. This mostly applies to the output of
.I genisoimage
when building the image.
.TP
\fB-V\fR
Display the version and quit.
.TP
\fB-w\fR
Wait for the user to press Enter before quitting the script. This is used by the .desktop launcher.

.SH BUGS
More bugs appear as distributions get updated and the MultiCD plugins become obsolete. Please report bugs on the Ubuntu Forums thread (there is a link at http://multicd.tuxfamily.org).
